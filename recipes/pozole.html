    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Red pozole is a traditional Mexican soup renowned for its rich and hearty flavors. This vibrant and enticing dish features tender hominy, slow-cooked pork or chicken, and an array of spices, all simmered in a savory and fiery red chili broth. The bright red hue comes from a blend of dried guajillo, ancho, and other chilies, infusing the broth with a delightful depth and smoky undertones. Garnished with fresh lime, shredded lettuce, diced onions, radishes, and chopped cilantro, red pozole offers a tantalizing mix of textures and a burst of zest with every spoonful. A cherished symbol of Mexican culinary heritage, it brings warmth and comfort to gatherings, celebrations, and family meals.

        <li>Add chopped onion, minced garlic, Mexican oregano, cumin, salt, and pepper to the blender.</li>
        <li>Puree the ingredients until you have a smooth red chili sauce.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, combine the pork or chicken chunks with the red chili sauce and cook over medium heat for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the hominy and enough chicken or vegetable broth to cover all the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Drop in a couple of bay leaves for extra flavor.</li>
        <li>Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer for about 1.5 to 2 hours until the meat is tender and flavors are well combined.</li>
        <li>While the pozole is simmering, prepare the garnishes: slice the radishes, dice the onions, and chop the cilantro.</li>
        <li>Once the pozole is ready, remove the bay leaves and serve it hot in bowls.</li>
